              A <strong>sandbox</strong> game is a video game with a gameplay
              element that provides the player a great degree of creativity to
              interact with, usually without any predetermined goal, or
              alternatively with a goal that the player sets for themselves.
              Such games may lack any objective, and are sometimes referred to
              as non-games or software toys. More often, sandbox games result
              from these creative elements being incorporated into other genres
              and allowing for emergent gameplay. Sandbox games are often
              associated with an open world concept which gives the player
              freedom of movement and progression in the game's world. The term
              "sandbox" derives from the nature of a sandbox that lets children
              create nearly anything they want within it.

              A platform game (often simplified as a jump 'n' run game) is a
              sub-genre of action video games in which the core objective is to
              move the player character between points in an environment.
              Platform games are characterized by levels that consist of uneven
              terrain and suspended platforms of varying height that require
              jumping and climbing to traverse. Other acrobatic maneuvers may
              factor into the gameplay, such as swinging from vines or grappling
              hooks, jumping off walls, air dashing, gliding through the air,
              being shot from cannons, or bouncing from springboards or
              trampolines. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as
              3D games in The Legend of Zelda series, fall outside of the genre.

              Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games
              that do not progress incrementally in turns, but allow all players
              to play simultaneously, in "real time". By contrast, in turn-based
              strategy (TBS) games, players take turns to play. The term
              "real-time strategy" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II
              in the early 1990s.
