              Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games that
            do not progress incrementally in turns, but allow all players to
            play simultaneously, in "real time". By contrast, in turn-based
            strategy (TBS) games, players take turns to play. The term
            "real-time strategy" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in
            the early 1990s.
